<h2>THE CHAPERON.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old lady, in a high
drawing-room, had had her chair moved close to the fire, where
she sat knitting and warming her knees.&nbsp; She was dressed in
deep mourning; her face had a faded nobleness, tempered, however,
by the somewhat illiberal compression assumed by her lips in
obedience to something that was passing in her mind.&nbsp; She
was far from the lamp, but though her eyes were fixed upon her
active needles she was not looking at them.&nbsp; What she really
saw was quite another train of affairs.&nbsp; The room was
spacious and dim; the thick London fog had oozed into it even
through its superior defences.&nbsp; It was full of dusky,
massive, valuable things.&nbsp; The old lady sat motionless save
for the regularity of her clicking needles, which seemed as
personal to her and as expressive as prolonged fingers.&nbsp; If
she was thinking something out, she was thinking it
thoroughly.</p>
<p>When she looked up, on the entrance of a girl of twenty, it
might have been guessed that the appearance of this young lady
was not an interruption of her meditation, but rather a
contribution to it.&nbsp; The young lady, who was charming to
behold, was also in deep mourning, which had a freshness, if
mourning can be fresh, an air of having been lately put on.&nbsp;
She went straight to the bell beside the chimney-piece and pulled
it, while in her other hand she held a sealed and directed
letter.&nbsp; Her companion glanced in silence at the letter;
then she looked still harder at her work.&nbsp; The girl hovered
near the fireplace, without speaking, and after a due, a
dignified interval the butler appeared in response to the
bell.&nbsp; The time had been sufficient to make the silence
between the ladies seem long.&nbsp; The younger one asked the
butler to see that her letter should be posted; and after he had
gone out she moved vaguely about the room, as if to give her
grandmother&mdash;for such was the elder personage&mdash;a chance
to begin a colloquy of which she herself preferred not to strike
the first note.&nbsp; As equally with herself her companion was
on the face of it capable of holding out, the tension, though it
was already late in the evening, might have lasted long.&nbsp;
But the old lady after a little appeared to recognise, a trifle
ungraciously, the girl&rsquo;s superior resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you written to your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but only a few lines, to tell her I shall come and
see her in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo; asked the
grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you want me to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to say that you&rsquo;ve made up your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve done that, granny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intend to respect your father&rsquo;s
wishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon what you mean by respecting them.&nbsp;
I do justice to the feelings by which they were
dictated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by justice?&rdquo; the old lady
retorted.</p>
<p>The girl was silent a moment; then she said:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see my idea of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it already!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll go and live with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall talk the situation over with her to-morrow and
tell her that I think that will be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best for her, no doubt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for her is best for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for your brother and sister?&rdquo;&nbsp; As the
girl made no reply to this her grandmother went on:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for them is that you should acknowledge
some responsibility in regard to them and, considering how young
they are, try and do something for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must do as I&rsquo;ve done&mdash;they must act for
themselves.&nbsp; They have their means now, and they&rsquo;re
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re mere children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me remind you that Eric is older than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like his mother,&rdquo; said the old
lady, as if that were an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said he did.&nbsp; And she adores
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your mother&rsquo;s adorations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse her now,&rdquo; the girl rejoined,
after a pause.</p>
<p>The old lady forbore to abuse her, but she made up for it the
next moment by saying: &ldquo;It will be dreadful for
Edith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will be dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your desertion of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desertion&rsquo;s on her side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her consideration for her father does her
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m a brute, <i>n&rsquo;en parlons
plus</i>,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must go our
respective ways,&rdquo; she added, in a tone of extreme wisdom
and philosophy.</p>
<p>Her grandmother straightened out her knitting and began to
roll it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be so good as to ring for my
maid,&rdquo; she said, after a minute.&nbsp; The young lady rang,
and there was another wait and another conscious hush.&nbsp;
Before the maid came her mistress remarked: &ldquo;Of course then
you&rsquo;ll not come to <i>me</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;coming&rsquo; to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t receive you on that footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not come <i>with</i> me, if you mean
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said the old lady,
getting up as her maid came in.&nbsp; This attendant took her
work from her, gave her an arm and helped her out of the room,
while Rose Tramore, standing before the fire and looking into it,
faced the idea that her grandmother&rsquo;s door would now under
all circumstances be closed to her.&nbsp; She lost no time
however in brooding over this anomaly: it only added energy to
her determination to act.&nbsp; All she could do to-night was to
go to bed, for she felt utterly weary.&nbsp; She had been living,
in imagination, in a prospective struggle, and it had left her as
exhausted as a real fight.&nbsp; Moreover this was the
culmination of a crisis, of weeks of suspense, of a long, hard
strain.&nbsp; Her father had been laid in his grave five days
before, and that morning his will had been read.&nbsp; In the
afternoon she had got Edith off to St. Leonard&rsquo;s with their
aunt Julia, and then she had had a wretched talk with Eric.&nbsp;
Lastly, she had made up her mind to act in opposition to the
formidable will, to a clause which embodied if not exactly a
provision, a recommendation singularly emphatic.&nbsp; She went
to bed and slept the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, how charming!&nbsp; I must take another
house!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in these words that her mother
responded to the announcement Rose had just formally made and
with which she had vaguely expected to produce a certain dignity
of effect.&nbsp; In the way of emotion there was apparently no
effect at all, and the girl was wise enough to know that this was
not simply on account of the general line of non-allusion taken
by the extremely pretty woman before her, who looked like her
elder sister.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had never manifested, to her
daughter, the slightest consciousness that her position was
peculiar; but the recollection of something more than that fine
policy was required to explain such a failure, to appreciate
Rose&rsquo;s sacrifice.&nbsp; It was simply a fresh reminder that
she had never appreciated anything, that she was nothing but a
tinted and stippled surface.&nbsp; Her situation was peculiar
indeed.&nbsp; She had been the heroine of a scandal which had
grown dim only because, in the eyes of the London world, it paled
in the lurid light of the contemporaneous.&nbsp; That attention
had been fixed on it for several days, fifteen years before;
there had been a high relish of the vivid evidence as to his
wife&rsquo;s misconduct with which, in the divorce-court, Charles
Tramore had judged well to regale a cynical public.&nbsp; The
case was pronounced awfully bad, and he obtained his
decree.&nbsp; The folly of the wife had been inconceivable, in
spite of other examples: she had quitted her children, she had
followed the &ldquo;other fellow&rdquo; abroad.&nbsp; The other
fellow hadn&rsquo;t married her, not having had time: he had lost
his life in the Mediterranean by the capsizing of a boat, before
the prohibitory term had expired.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore had striven to extract from this accident
something of the austerity of widowhood; but her mourning only
made her deviation more public, she was a widow whose husband was
awkwardly alive.&nbsp; She had not prowled about the Continent on
the classic lines; she had come back to London to take her
chance.&nbsp; But London would give her no chance, would have
nothing to say to her; as many persons had remarked, you could
never tell how London would behave.&nbsp; It would not receive
Mrs. Tramore again on any terms, and when she was spoken of,
which now was not often, it was inveterately said of her that she
went nowhere.&nbsp; Apparently she had not the qualities for
which London compounds; though in the cases in which it does
compound you may often wonder what these qualities are.&nbsp; She
had not at any rate been successful: her lover was dead, her
husband was liked and her children were pitied, for in payment
for a topic London will parenthetically pity.&nbsp; It was
thought interesting and magnanimous that Charles Tramore had not
married again.&nbsp; The disadvantage to his children of the
miserable story was thus left uncorrected, and this, rather
oddly, was counted as <i>his</i> sacrifice.&nbsp; His mother,
whose arrangements were elaborate, looked after them a great
deal, and they enjoyed a mixture of laxity and discipline under
the roof of their aunt, Miss Tramore, who was independent,
having, for reasons that the two ladies had exhaustively
discussed, determined to lead her own life.&nbsp; She had set up
a home at St. Leonard&rsquo;s, and that contracted shore had
played a considerable part in the upbringing of the little
Tramores.&nbsp; They knew about their mother, as the phrase was,
but they didn&rsquo;t know her; which was naturally deemed more
pathetic for them than for her.&nbsp; She had a house in Chester
Square and an income and a victoria&mdash;it served all purposes,
as she never went out in the evening&mdash;and flowers on her
window-sills, and a remarkable appearance of youth.&nbsp; The
income was supposed to be in part the result of a bequest from
the man for whose sake she had committed the error of her life,
and in the appearance of youth there was a slightly impertinent
implication that it was a sort of afterglow of the same
connection.</p>
<p>Her children, as they grew older, fortunately showed signs of
some individuality of disposition.&nbsp; Edith, the second girl,
clung to her aunt Julia; Eric, the son, clung frantically to
polo; while Rose, the elder daughter, appeared to cling mainly to
herself.&nbsp; Collectively, of course, they clung to their
father, whose attitude in the family group, however, was casual
and intermittent.&nbsp; He was charming and vague; he was like a
clever actor who often didn&rsquo;t come to rehearsal.&nbsp;
Fortune, which but for that one stroke had been generous to him,
had provided him with deputies and trouble-takers, as well as
with whimsical opinions, and a reputation for excellent taste,
and whist at his club, and perpetual cigars on morocco sofas, and
a beautiful absence of purpose.&nbsp; Nature had thrown in a
remarkably fine hand, which he sometimes passed over his
children&rsquo;s heads when they were glossy from the nursery
brush.&nbsp; On Rose&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday he said to her
that she might go to see her mother, on condition that her visits
should be limited to an hour each time and to four in the
year.&nbsp; She was to go alone; the other children were not
included in the arrangement.&nbsp; This was the result of a visit
that he himself had paid his repudiated wife at her urgent
request, their only encounter during the fifteen years.&nbsp; The
girl knew as much as this from her aunt Julia, who was full of
tell-tale secrecies.&nbsp; She availed herself eagerly of the
license, and in course of the period that elapsed before her
father&rsquo;s death she spent with Mrs. Tramore exactly eight
hours by the watch.&nbsp; Her father, who was as inconsistent and
disappointing as he was amiable, spoke to her of her mother only
once afterwards.&nbsp; This occasion had been the sequel of her
first visit, and he had made no use of it to ask what she thought
of the personality in Chester Square or how she liked it.&nbsp;
He had only said &ldquo;Did she take you out?&rdquo; and when
Rose answered &ldquo;Yes, she put me straight into a carriage and
drove me up and down Bond Street,&rdquo; had rejoined sharply
&ldquo;See that that never occurs again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It never
did, but once was enough, every one they knew having happened to
be in Bond Street at that particular hour.</p>
<p>After this the periodical interview took place in private, in
Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s beautiful little wasted drawing-room.&nbsp;
Rose knew that, rare as these occasions were, her mother would
not have kept her &ldquo;all to herself&rdquo; had there been
anybody she could have shown her to.&nbsp; But in the poor
lady&rsquo;s social void there was no one; she had after all her
own correctness and she consistently preferred isolation to
inferior contacts.&nbsp; So her daughter was subjected only to
the maternal; it was not necessary to be definite in qualifying
that.&nbsp; The girl had by this time a collection of ideas,
gathered by impenetrable processes; she had tasted, in the
ostracism of her ambiguous parent, of the acrid fruit of the tree
of knowledge.&nbsp; She not only had an approximate vision of
what every one had done, but she had a private judgment for each
case.&nbsp; She had a particular vision of her father, which did
not interfere with his being dear to her, but which was directly
concerned in her resolution, after his death, to do the special
thing he had expressed the wish she should not do.&nbsp; In the
general estimate her grandmother and her grandmother&rsquo;s
money had their place, and the strong probability that any
enjoyment of the latter commodity would now be withheld from
her.&nbsp; It included Edith&rsquo;s marked inclination to
receive the law, and doubtless eventually a more substantial
memento, from Miss Tramore, and opened the question whether her
own course might not contribute to make her sister&rsquo;s appear
heartless.&nbsp; The answer to this question however would depend
on the success that might attend her own, which would very
possibly be small.&nbsp; Eric&rsquo;s attitude was eminently
simple; he didn&rsquo;t care to know people who didn&rsquo;t know
<i>his</i> people.&nbsp; If his mother should ever get back into
society perhaps he would take her up.&nbsp; Rose Tramore had
decided to do what she could to bring this consummation about;
and strangely enough&mdash;so mixed were her superstitions and
her heresies&mdash;a large part of her motive lay in the value
she attached to such a consecration.</p>
<p>Of her mother intrinsically she thought very little now, and
if her eyes were fixed on a special achievement it was much more
for the sake of that achievement and to satisfy a latent energy
that was in her than because her heart was wrung by this
sufferer.&nbsp; Her heart had not been wrung at all, though she
had quite held it out for the experience.&nbsp; Her purpose was a
pious game, but it was still essentially a game.&nbsp; Among the
ideas I have mentioned she had her idea of triumph.&nbsp; She had
caught the inevitable note, the pitch, on her very first visit to
Chester Square.&nbsp; She had arrived there in intense
excitement, and her excitement was left on her hands in a manner
that reminded her of a difficult air she had once heard sung at
the opera when no one applauded the performer.&nbsp; That
flatness had made her sick, and so did this, in another
way.&nbsp; A part of her agitation proceeded from the fact that
her aunt Julia had told her, in the manner of a burst of
confidence, something she was not to repeat, that she was in
appearance the very image of the lady in Chester Square.&nbsp;
The motive that prompted this declaration was between aunt Julia
and her conscience; but it was a great emotion to the girl to
find her entertainer so beautiful.&nbsp; She was tall and
exquisitely slim; she had hair more exactly to Rose
Tramore&rsquo;s taste than any other she had ever seen, even to
every detail in the way it was dressed, and a complexion and a
figure of the kind that are always spoken of as
&ldquo;lovely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes were irresistible, and so
were her clothes, though the clothes were perhaps a little more
precisely the right thing than the eyes.&nbsp; Her appearance was
marked to her daughter&rsquo;s sense by the highest distinction;
though it may be mentioned that this had never been the opinion
of all the world.&nbsp; It was a revelation to Rose that she
herself might look a little like that.&nbsp; She knew however
that aunt Julia had not seen her deposed sister-in-law for a long
time, and she had a general impression that Mrs. Tramore was
to-day a more complete production&mdash;for instance as regarded
her air of youth&mdash;than she had ever been.&nbsp; There was no
excitement on her side&mdash;that was all her visitor&rsquo;s;
there was no emotion&mdash;that was excluded by the plan, to say
nothing of conditions more primal.&nbsp; Rose had from the first
a glimpse of her mother&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; It was to mention
nothing and imply nothing, neither to acknowledge, to explain nor
to extenuate.&nbsp; She would leave everything to her child; with
her child she was secure.&nbsp; She only wanted to get back into
society; she would leave even that to her child, whom she treated
not as a high-strung and heroic daughter, a creature of
exaltation, of devotion, but as a new, charming, clever, useful
friend, a little younger than herself.&nbsp; Already on that
first day she had talked about dressmakers.&nbsp; Of course, poor
thing, it was to be remembered that in her circumstances there
were not many things she <i>could</i> talk about.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wants to go out again; that&rsquo;s the only thing in
the wide world she wants,&rdquo; Rose had promptly, compendiously
said to herself.&nbsp; There had been a sequel to this
observation, uttered, in intense engrossment, in her own room
half an hour before she had, on the important evening, made known
her decision to her grandmother: &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll
<i>take</i> her out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drag you down, she&rsquo;ll drag you
down!&rdquo; Julia Tramore permitted herself to remark to her
niece, the next day, in a tone of feverish prophecy.</p>
<p>As the girl&rsquo;s own theory was that all the dragging there
might be would be upward, and moreover administered by herself,
she could look at her aunt with a cold and inscrutable eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I shall be out of your sight, from the
pinnacle you occupy, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t trouble
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you reproach me for my disinterested exertions, for
the way I&rsquo;ve toiled over you, the way I&rsquo;ve lived for
you?&rdquo; Miss Tramore demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproach <i>me</i> for being kind to my
mother and I won&rsquo;t reproach you for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep you out of
everything&mdash;she&rsquo;ll make you miss everything,&rdquo;
Miss Tramore continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll make me miss a great deal
that&rsquo;s odious,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young for such extravagances,&rdquo;
her aunt declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet Edith, who is younger than I, seems to be too
old for them: how do you arrange that?&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s
society will make me older,&rdquo; Rose replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me of your mother; you <i>have</i>
no mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if I&rsquo;m an orphan I must settle things for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you justify her, do you approve of her?&rdquo; cried
Miss Tramore, who was inferior to her niece in capacity for
retort and whose limitations made the girl appear pert.</p>
<p>Rose looked at her a moment in silence; then she said, turning
away: &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you propose to become charming in the same
manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her manner is perfect; it would be an excellent
model.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t discuss my mother with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to discuss her with some other
people!&rdquo; Miss Tramore proclaimed, going out of the
room.</p>
<p>Rose wondered whether this were a general or a particular
vaticination.&nbsp; There was something her aunt might have meant
by it, but her aunt rarely meant the best thing she might have
meant.&nbsp; Miss Tramore had come up from St. Leonard&rsquo;s in
response to a telegram from her own parent, for an occasion like
the present brought with it, for a few hours, a certain
relaxation of their dissent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do what you can to stop
her,&rdquo; the old lady had said; but her daughter found that
the most she could do was not much.&nbsp; They both had a baffled
sense that Rose had thought the question out a good deal further
than they; and this was particularly irritating to Mrs. Tramore,
as consciously the cleverer of the two.&nbsp; A question thought
out as far as <i>she</i> could think it had always appeared to
her to have performed its human uses; she had never encountered a
ghost emerging from that extinction.&nbsp; Their great contention
was that Rose would cut herself off; and certainly if she
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of that she wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
anything.&nbsp; Julia Tramore could only tell her mother how
little the girl was afraid.&nbsp; She was already prepared to
leave the house, taking with her the possessions, or her share of
them, that had accumulated there during her father&rsquo;s
illness.&nbsp; There had been a going and coming of her maid, a
thumping about of boxes, an ordering of four-wheelers; it
appeared to old Mrs. Tramore that something of the
objectionableness, the indecency, of her granddaughter&rsquo;s
prospective connection had already gathered about the
place.&nbsp; It was a violation of the decorum of bereavement
which was still fresh there, and from the indignant gloom of the
mistress of the house you might have inferred not so much that
the daughter was about to depart as that the mother was about to
arrive.&nbsp; There had been no conversation on the dreadful
subject at luncheon; for at luncheon at Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s (her
son never came to it) there were always, even after funerals and
other miseries, stray guests of both sexes whose policy it was to
be cheerful and superficial.&nbsp; Rose had sat down as if
nothing had happened&mdash;nothing worse, that is, than her
father&rsquo;s death; but no one had spoken of anything that any
one else was thinking of.</p>
<p>Before she left the house a servant brought her a message from
her grandmother&mdash;the old lady desired to see her in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; She had on her bonnet, and she went down as
if she were about to step into her cab.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore sat
there with her eternal knitting, from which she forebore even to
raise her eyes as, after a silence that seemed to express the
fulness of her reprobation, while Rose stood motionless, she
began: &ldquo;I wonder if you really understand what you&rsquo;re
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought you were; but I don&rsquo;t know what
to make of you now.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re giving up
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was tempted to inquire whether her grandmother called
herself &ldquo;everything&rdquo;; but she checked this question,
answering instead that she knew she was giving up much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a step of which you will feel the
effect to the end of your days,&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a good conscience, I heartily hope,&rdquo; said
Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s conscience was good enough for his
mother; it ought to be good enough for his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose sat down&mdash;she could afford to&mdash;as if she wished
to be very attentive and were still accessible to argument.&nbsp;
But this demonstration only ushered in, after a moment, the
surprising words &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think papa had any
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of all that&rsquo;s unnatural do you
mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore cried, over her glasses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The dearest and best creature that ever lived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was kind, he had charming impulses, he was
delightful.&nbsp; But he never reflected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore stared, as if at a language she had never heard,
a farrago, a <i>galimatias</i>.&nbsp; Her life was made up of
items, but she had never had to deal, intellectually, with a fine
shade.&nbsp; Then while her needles, which had paused an instant,
began to fly again, she rejoined: &ldquo;Do you know what you
are, my dear?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a dreadful little prig.&nbsp;
Where do you pick up such talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mean to judge between
them,&rdquo; Rose pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can only judge between
my mother and myself.&nbsp; Papa couldn&rsquo;t judge for
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this she got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were horrid.&nbsp; I never thought
so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re embarking on a struggle with
society,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Tramore, indulging in an unusual
flight of oratory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Society will put you in your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it too many other things to do?&rdquo;
asked the girl.</p>
<p>This question had an ingenuity which led her grandmother to
meet it with a merely provisional and somewhat sketchy
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your ignorance would be melancholy if your
behaviour were not so insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I know perfectly what she&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;
Rose replied, almost gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll drag me
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t even do that,&rdquo; the old lady
declared contradictiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll keep you
forever in the same dull hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come and see <i>you</i>, granny, when I want
something more lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come if you like, but you&rsquo;ll come no
further than the door.&nbsp; If you leave this house now you
don&rsquo;t enter it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you really mean
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may judge whether I choose such a time to
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose quitted the room successfully enough; but on the other
side of the door, on the landing, she sank into a chair and
buried her face in her hands.&nbsp; She had burst into tears, and
she sobbed there for a moment, trying hard to recover herself, so
as to go downstairs without showing any traces of emotion,
passing before the servants and again perhaps before aunt
Julia.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore was too old to cry; she could only drop
her knitting and, for a long time, sit with her head bowed and
her eyes closed.</p>
<p>Rose had reckoned justly with her aunt Julia; there were no
footmen, but this vigilant virgin was posted at the foot of the
stairs.&nbsp; She offered no challenge however; she only said:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one in the parlour who wants to see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl demanded a name, but Miss Tramore only
mouthed inaudibly and winked and waved.&nbsp; Rose instantly
reflected that there was only one man in the world her aunt would
look such deep things about.&nbsp; &ldquo;Captain Jay?&rdquo; her
own eyes asked, while Miss Tramore&rsquo;s were those of a
conspirator: they were, for a moment, the only embarrassed eyes
Rose had encountered that day.&nbsp; They contributed to make
aunt Julia&rsquo;s further response evasive, after her niece
inquired if she had communicated in advance with this
visitor.&nbsp; Miss Tramore merely said that he had been upstairs
with her mother&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t she mentioned it?&mdash;and
had been waiting for her.&nbsp; She thought herself acute in not
putting the question of the girl&rsquo;s seeing him before her as
a favour to him or to herself; she presented it as a duty, and
wound up with the proposition: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to him,
it&rsquo;s not kind, not to let him speak to you before you
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want to say?&rdquo; Rose demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She really knew, for she had found out before; but after
standing uncertain an instant she went in.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
parlour&rdquo; was the name that had always been borne by a
spacious sitting-room downstairs, an apartment occupied by her
father during his frequent phases of residence in Hill
Street&mdash;episodes increasingly frequent after his house in
the country had, in consequence, as Rose perfectly knew, of his
spending too much money, been disposed of at a sacrifice which he
always characterised as horrid.&nbsp; He had been left with the
place in Hertfordshire and his mother with the London house, on
the general understanding that they would change about; but
during the last years the community had grown more rigid, mainly
at his mother&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; The parlour was full of his
memory and his habits and his things&mdash;his books and pictures
and <i>bibelots</i>, objects that belonged now to Eric.&nbsp;
Rose had sat in it for hours since his death; it was the place in
which she could still be nearest to him.&nbsp; But she felt far
from him as Captain Jay rose erect on her opening the door.&nbsp;
This was a very different presence.&nbsp; He had not liked
Captain Jay.&nbsp; She herself had, but not enough to make a
great complication of her father&rsquo;s coldness.&nbsp; This
afternoon however she foresaw complications.&nbsp; At the very
outset for instance she was not pleased with his having arranged
such a surprise for her with her grandmother and her aunt.&nbsp;
It was probably aunt Julia who had sent for him; her grandmother
wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.&nbsp; It placed him immediately on
their side, and Rose was almost as disappointed at this as if she
had not known it was quite where he would naturally be.&nbsp; He
had never paid her a special visit, but if that was what he
wished to do why shouldn&rsquo;t he have waited till she should
be under her mother&rsquo;s roof?&nbsp; She knew the reason, but
she had an angry prospect of enjoyment in making him express
it.&nbsp; She liked him enough, after all, if it were measured by
the idea of what she could make him do.</p>
<p>In Bertram Jay the elements were surprisingly mingled; you
would have gone astray, in reading him, if you had counted on
finding the complements of some of his qualities.&nbsp; He would
not however have struck you in the least as incomplete, for in
every case in which you didn&rsquo;t find the complement you
would have found the contradiction.&nbsp; He was in the Royal
Engineers, and was tall, lean and high-shouldered.&nbsp; He
looked every inch a soldier, yet there were people who considered
that he had missed his vocation in not becoming a parson.&nbsp;
He took a public interest in the spiritual life of the
army.&nbsp; Other persons still, on closer observation, would
have felt that his most appropriate field was neither the army
nor the church, but simply the world&mdash;the social,
successful, worldly world.&nbsp; If he had a sword in one hand
and a Bible in the other he had a Court Guide concealed somewhere
about his person.&nbsp; His profile was hard and handsome, his
eyes were both cold and kind, his dark straight hair was
imperturbably smooth and prematurely streaked with grey.&nbsp;
There was nothing in existence that he didn&rsquo;t take
seriously.&nbsp; He had a first-rate power of work and an
ambition as minutely organised as a German plan of
invasion.&nbsp; His only real recreation was to go to church, but
he went to parties when he had time.&nbsp; If he was in love with
Rose Tramore this was distracting to him only in the same sense
as his religion, and it was included in that department of his
extremely sub-divided life.&nbsp; His religion indeed was of an
encroaching, annexing sort.&nbsp; Seen from in front he looked
diffident and blank, but he was capable of exposing himself in a
way (to speak only of the paths of peace) wholly inconsistent
with shyness.&nbsp; He had a passion for instance for open-air
speaking, but was not thought on the whole to excel in it unless
he could help himself out with a hymn.&nbsp; In conversation he
kept his eyes on you with a kind of colourless candour, as if he
had not understood what you were saying and, in a fashion that
made many people turn red, waited before answering.&nbsp; This
was only because he was considering their remarks in more
relations than they had intended.&nbsp; He had in his face no
expression whatever save the one just mentioned, and was, in his
profession, already very distinguished.</p>
<p>He had seen Rose Tramore for the first time on a Sunday of the
previous March, at a house in the country at which she was
staying with her father, and five weeks later he had made her, by
letter, an offer of marriage.&nbsp; She showed her father the
letter of course, and he told her that it would give him great
pleasure that she should send Captain Jay about his
business.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
must really have some one who will be better fun than
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose had declined the honour, very
considerately and kindly, but not simply because her father
wished it.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t herself wish to detach this
flower from the stem, though when the young man wrote again, to
express the hope that he <i>might</i> hope&mdash;so long was he
willing to wait&mdash;and ask if he might not still sometimes see
her, she answered even more indulgently than at first.&nbsp; She
had shown her father her former letter, but she didn&rsquo;t show
him this one; she only told him what it contained, submitting to
him also that of her correspondent.&nbsp; Captain Jay moreover
wrote to Mr. Tramore, who replied sociably, but so vaguely that
he almost neglected the subject under discussion&mdash;a
communication that made poor Bertram ponder long.&nbsp; He could
never get to the bottom of the superficial, and all the
proprieties and conventions of life were profound to him.&nbsp;
Fortunately for him old Mrs. Tramore liked him, he was
satisfactory to her long-sightedness; so that a relation was
established under cover of which he still occasionally presented
himself in Hill Street&mdash;presented himself nominally to the
mistress of the house.&nbsp; He had had scruples about the
veracity of his visits, but he had disposed of them; he had
scruples about so many things that he had had to invent a general
way, to dig a central drain.&nbsp; Julia Tramore happened to meet
him when she came up to town, and she took a view of him more
benevolent than her usual estimate of people encouraged by her
mother.&nbsp; The fear of agreeing with that lady was a motive,
but there was a stronger one, in this particular case, in the
fear of agreeing with her niece, who had rejected him.&nbsp; His
situation might be held to have improved when Mr. Tramore was
taken so gravely ill that with regard to his recovery those about
him left their eyes to speak for their lips; and in the light of
the poor gentleman&rsquo;s recent death it was doubtless better
than it had ever been.</p>
<p>He was only a quarter of an hour with the girl, but this gave
him time to take the measure of it.&nbsp; After he had spoken to
her about her bereavement, very much as an especially mild
missionary might have spoken to a beautiful Polynesian, he let
her know that he had learned from her companions the very strong
step she was about to take.&nbsp; This led to their spending
together ten minutes which, to her mind, threw more light on his
character than anything that had ever passed between them.&nbsp;
She had always felt with him as if she were standing on an edge,
looking down into something decidedly deep.&nbsp; To-day the
impression of the perpendicular shaft was there, but it was
rather an abyss of confusion and disorder than the large bright
space in which she had figured everything as ranged and
pigeon-holed, presenting the appearance of the labelled shelves
and drawers at a chemist&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He discussed without an
invitation to discuss, he appealed without a right to
appeal.&nbsp; He was nothing but a suitor tolerated after
dismissal, but he took strangely for granted a participation in
her affairs.&nbsp; He assumed all sorts of things that made her
draw back.&nbsp; He implied that there was everything now to
assist them in arriving at an agreement, since she had never
informed him that he was positively objectionable; but that this
symmetry would be spoiled if she should not be willing to take a
little longer to think of certain consequences.&nbsp; She was
greatly disconcerted when she saw what consequences he meant and
at his reminding her of them.&nbsp; What on earth was the use of
a lover if he was to speak only like one&rsquo;s grandmother and
one&rsquo;s aunt?&nbsp; He struck her as much in love with her
and as particularly careful at the same time as to what he might
say.&nbsp; He never mentioned her mother; he only alluded,
indirectly but earnestly, to the &ldquo;step.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
disapproved of it altogether, took an unexpectedly prudent,
politic view of it.&nbsp; He evidently also believed that she
would be dragged down; in other words that she would not be asked
out.&nbsp; It was his idea that her mother would contaminate her,
so that he should find himself interested in a young person
discredited and virtually unmarriageable.&nbsp; All this was more
obvious to him than the consideration that a daughter should be
merciful.&nbsp; Where was his religion if he understood mercy so
little, and where were his talent and his courage if he were so
miserably afraid of trumpery social penalties?&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s
heart sank when she reflected that a man supposed to be
first-rate hadn&rsquo;t guessed that rather than not do what she
could for her mother she would give up all the Engineers in the
world.&nbsp; She became aware that she probably would have been
moved to place her hand in his on the spot if he had come to her
saying &ldquo;Your idea is the right one; put it through at every
cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t discuss this with him,
though he impressed her as having too much at stake for her to
treat him with mere disdain.&nbsp; She sickened at the revelation
that a gentleman could see so much in mere vulgarities of
opinion, and though she uttered as few words as possible,
conversing only in sad smiles and headshakes and in intercepted
movements toward the door, she happened, in some unguarded lapse
from her reticence, to use the expression that she was
disappointed in him.&nbsp; He caught at it and, seeming to drop
his field-glass, pressed upon her with nearer, tenderer eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I be so happy as to believe, then, that you had
thought of me with some confidence, with some faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t suppose so, what is the sense of
this visit?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can be faithful without reciprocity,&rdquo; said
the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I regard you in a light which makes
me want to protect you even if I have nothing to gain by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you speak as if you thought you might keep me for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>yourself</i>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to
suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to suffer yourself by my doing so,&rdquo; said
Rose, looking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if you would only marry me next month!&rdquo; he
broke out inconsequently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give up going to mamma?&rdquo; Rose waited to see
if he would say &ldquo;What need that matter?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
your mother come to us?&rdquo;&nbsp; But he said nothing of the
sort; he only answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She surely would be sorry to interfere with the
exercise of any other affection which I might have the bliss of
believing that you are now free, in however small a degree, to
entertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose knew that her mother wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry at all; but
she contented herself with rejoining, her hand on the door:
&ldquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t suffer.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how terrible, how cruel, the world
can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do know.&nbsp; I know everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The declaration sprang from her lips in a tone which made him
look at her as he had never looked before, as if he saw something
new in her face, as if he had never yet known her.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t displeased her so much but that she would like to
give him that impression, and since she felt that she was doing
so she lingered an instant for the purpose.&nbsp; It enabled her
to see, further, that he turned red; then to become aware that a
carriage had stopped at the door.&nbsp; Captain Jay&rsquo;s eyes,
from where he stood, fell upon this arrival, and the nature of
their glance made Rose step forward to look.&nbsp; Her mother sat
there, brilliant, conspicuous, in the eternal victoria, and the
footman was already sounding the knocker.&nbsp; It had been no
part of the arrangement that she should come to fetch her; it had
been out of the question&mdash;a stroke in such bad taste as
would have put Rose in the wrong.&nbsp; The girl had never
dreamed of it, but somehow, suddenly, perversely, she was glad of
it now; she even hoped that her grandmother and her aunt were
looking out upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother has come for me.&nbsp; Good-bye,&rdquo; she
repeated; but this time her visitor had got between her and the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me before you go.&nbsp; I will give you a
life&rsquo;s devotion,&rdquo; the young man pleaded.&nbsp; He
really barred the way.</p>
<p>She wondered whether her grandmother had told him that if her
flight were not prevented she would forfeit money.&nbsp; Then,
vividly, it came over her that this would be what he was occupied
with.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never think of you&mdash;let me
go!&rdquo; she cried, with passion.</p>
<p>Captain Jay opened the door, but Rose didn&rsquo;t see his
face, and in a moment she was out of the house.&nbsp; Aunt Julia,
who was sure to have been hovering, had taken flight before the
profanity of the knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, dear, where did you get your mourning?&rdquo;
the lady in the victoria asked of her daughter as they drove
away.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Maresfield</span> had given her boy a
push in his plump back and had said to him, &ldquo;Go and speak
to her now; it&rsquo;s your chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had for a
long time wanted this scion to make himself audible to Rose
Tramore, but the opportunity was not easy to come by.&nbsp; The
case was complicated.&nbsp; Lady Maresfield had four daughters,
of whom only one was married.&nbsp; It so happened moreover that
this one, Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey, the only person in the world her
mother was afraid of, was the most to be reckoned with.&nbsp; The
Honourable Guy was in appearance all his mother&rsquo;s child,
though he was really a simpler soul.&nbsp; He was large and pink;
large, that is, as to everything but the eyes, which were
diminishing points, and pink as to everything but the hair, which
was comparable, faintly, to the hue of the richer rose.&nbsp; He
had also, it must be conceded, very small neat teeth, which made
his smile look like a young lady&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had no wish to
resemble any such person, but he was perpetually smiling, and he
smiled more than ever as he approached Rose Tramore, who, looking
altogether, to his mind, as a pretty girl should, and wearing a
soft white opera-cloak over a softer black dress, leaned alone
against the wall of the vestibule at Covent Garden while, a few
paces off, an old gentleman engaged her mother in
conversation.&nbsp; Madame Patti had been singing, and they were
all waiting for their carriages.&nbsp; To their ears at present
came a vociferation of names and a rattle of wheels.&nbsp; The
air, through banging doors, entered in damp, warm gusts, heavy
with the stale, slightly sweet taste of the London season when
the London season is overripe and spoiling.</p>
<p>Guy Mangler had only three minutes to re&euml;stablish an
interrupted acquaintance with our young lady.&nbsp; He reminded
her that he had danced with her the year before, and he mentioned
that he knew her brother.&nbsp; His mother had lately been to see
old Mrs. Tramore, but this he did not mention, not being aware of
it.&nbsp; That visit had produced, on Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s
part, a private crisis, engendered ideas.&nbsp; One of them was
that the grandmother in Hill Street had really forgiven the
wilful girl much more than she admitted.&nbsp; Another was that
there would still be some money for Rose when the others should
come into theirs.&nbsp; Still another was that the others would
come into theirs at no distant date; the old lady was so visibly
going to pieces.&nbsp; There were several more besides, as for
instance that Rose had already fifteen hundred a year from her
father.&nbsp; The figure had been betrayed in Hill Street; it was
part of the proof of Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s decrepitude.&nbsp; Then
there was an equal amount that her mother had to dispose of and
on which the girl could absolutely count, though of course it
might involve much waiting, as the mother, a person of gross
insensibility, evidently wouldn&rsquo;t die of
cold-shouldering.&nbsp; Equally definite, to do it justice, was
the conception that Rose was in truth remarkably good looking,
and that what she had undertaken to do showed, and would show
even should it fail, cleverness of the right sort.&nbsp;
Cleverness of the right sort was exactly the quality that Lady
Maresfield prefigured as indispensable in a young lady to whom
she should marry her second son, over whose own deficiencies she
flung the veil of a maternal theory that <i>his</i> cleverness
was of a sort that was wrong.&nbsp; Those who knew him less well
were content to wish that he might not conceal it for such a
scruple.&nbsp; This enumeration of his mother&rsquo;s views does
not exhaust the list, and it was in obedience to one too profound
to be uttered even by the historian that, after a very brief
delay, she decided to move across the crowded lobby.&nbsp; Her
daughter Bessie was the only one with her; Maggie was dining with
the Vaughan-Veseys, and Fanny was not of an age.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore the younger showed only an admirable back&mdash;her face
was to her old gentleman&mdash;and Bessie had drifted to some
other people; so that it was comparatively easy for Lady
Maresfield to say to Rose, in a moment: &ldquo;My dear child, are
you never coming to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be delighted to come if you&rsquo;ll ask
us,&rdquo; Rose smiled.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield had been prepared for the plural number, and
she was a woman whom it took many plurals to disconcert.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Guy is longing for another dance with
you,&rdquo; she rejoined, with the most unblinking
irrelevance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re not dancing again quite
yet,&rdquo; said Rose, glancing at her mother&rsquo;s exposed
shoulders, but speaking as if they were muffled in crape.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield leaned her head on one side and seemed almost
wistful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not even at my sister&rsquo;s ball?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s to have something next week.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll write
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Tramore, on the spot, looking bright but vague, turned
three or four things over in her mind.&nbsp; She remembered that
the sister of her interlocutress was the proverbially rich Mrs.
Bray, a bankeress or a breweress or a builderess, who had so big
a house that she couldn&rsquo;t fill it unless she opened her
doors, or her mouth, very wide.&nbsp; Rose had learnt more about
London society during these lonely months with her mother than
she had ever picked up in Hill Street.&nbsp; The younger Mrs.
Tramore was a mine of <i>comm&eacute;rages</i>, and she had no
need to go out to bring home the latest intelligence.&nbsp; At
any rate Mrs. Bray might serve as the end of a wedge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say we might think of that,&rdquo; Rose
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be very kind of your
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy&rsquo;ll think of it, won&rsquo;t you, Guy?&rdquo;
asked Lady Maresfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; Guy responded, with an intonation as
fine as if he had learnt it at a music hall; while at the same
moment the name of his mother&rsquo;s carriage was bawled through
the place.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had parted with her old gentleman;
she turned again to her daughter.&nbsp; Nothing occurred but what
always occurred, which was exactly this absence of
everything&mdash;a universal lapse.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t exist,
even for a second, to any recognising eye.&nbsp; The people who
looked at her&mdash;of course there were plenty of
those&mdash;were only the people who didn&rsquo;t exist for
hers.&nbsp; Lady Maresfield surged away on her son&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>It was this noble matron herself who wrote, the next day,
inclosing a card of invitation from Mrs. Bray and expressing the
hope that Rose would come and dine and let her ladyship take
her.&nbsp; She should have only one of her own girls; Gwendolen
Vesey was to take the other.&nbsp; Rose handed both the note and
the card in silence to her mother; the latter exhibited only the
name of Miss Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had much better go,
dear,&rdquo; her mother said; in answer to which Miss Tramore
slowly tore up the documents, looking with clear, meditative eyes
out of the window.&nbsp; Her mother always said &ldquo;You had
better go&rdquo;&mdash;there had been other incidents&mdash;and
Rose had never even once taken account of the observation.&nbsp;
She would make no first advances, only plenty of second ones,
and, condoning no discrimination, would treat no omission as
venial.&nbsp; She would keep all concessions till afterwards;
then she would make them one by one.&nbsp; Fighting society was
quite as hard as her grandmother had said it would be; but there
was a tension in it which made the dreariness vibrate&mdash;the
dreariness of such a winter as she had just passed.&nbsp; Her
companion had cried at the end of it, and she had cried all
through; only her tears had been private, while her
mother&rsquo;s had fallen once for all, at luncheon on the bleak
Easter Monday&mdash;produced by the way a silent survey of the
deadly square brought home to her that every creature but
themselves was out of town and having tremendous fun.&nbsp; Rose
felt that it was useless to attempt to explain simply by her
mourning this severity of solitude; for if people didn&rsquo;t go
to parties (at least a few didn&rsquo;t) for six months after
their father died, this was the very time other people took for
coming to see them.&nbsp; It was not too much to say that during
this first winter of Rose&rsquo;s period with her mother she had
no communication whatever with the world.&nbsp; It had the effect
of making her take to reading the new American books: she wanted
to see how girls got on by themselves.&nbsp; She had never read
so much before, and there was a legitimate indifference in it
when topics failed with her mother.&nbsp; They often failed after
the first days, and then, while she bent over instructive
volumes, this lady, dressed as if for an impending function, sat
on the sofa and watched her.&nbsp; Rose was not embarrassed by
such an appearance, for she could reflect that, a little before,
her companion had not even a girl who had taken refuge in queer
researches to look at.&nbsp; She was moreover used to her
mother&rsquo;s attitude by this time.&nbsp; She had her own
description of it: it was the attitude of waiting for the
carriage.&nbsp; If they didn&rsquo;t go out it was not that Mrs.
Tramore was not ready in time, and Rose had even an alarmed
prevision of their some day always arriving first.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore&rsquo;s conversation at such moments was abrupt,
inconsequent and personal.&nbsp; She sat on the edge of sofas and
chairs and glanced occasionally at the fit of her gloves (she was
perpetually gloved, and the fit was a thing it was melancholy to
see wasted), as people do who are expecting guests to
dinner.&nbsp; Rose used almost to fancy herself at times a
perfunctory husband on the other side of the fire.</p>
<p>What she was not yet used to&mdash;there was still a charm in
it&mdash;was her mother&rsquo;s extraordinary tact.&nbsp; During
the years they lived together they never had a discussion; a
circumstance all the more remarkable since if the girl had a
reason for sparing her companion (that of being sorry for her)
Mrs. Tramore had none for sparing her child.&nbsp; She only
showed in doing so a happy instinct&mdash;the happiest thing
about her.&nbsp; She took in perfection a course which
represented everything and covered everything; she utterly
abjured all authority.&nbsp; She testified to her abjuration in
hourly ingenious, touching ways.&nbsp; In this manner nothing had
to be talked over, which was a mercy all round.&nbsp; The tears
on Easter Monday were merely a nervous gust, to help show she was
not a Christmas doll from the Burlington Arcade; and there was no
lifting up of the repentant Magdalen, no uttered remorse for the
former abandonment of children.&nbsp; Of the way she could treat
her children her demeanour to this one was an example; it was an
uninterrupted appeal to her eldest daughter for direction.&nbsp;
She took the law from Rose in every circumstance, and if you had
noticed these ladies without knowing their history you would have
wondered what tie was fine enough to make maturity so respectful
to youth.&nbsp; No mother was ever so filial as Mrs. Tramore, and
there had never been such a difference of position between
sisters.&nbsp; Not that the elder one fawned, which would have
been fearful; she only renounced&mdash;whatever she had to
renounce.&nbsp; If the amount was not much she at any rate made
no scene over it.&nbsp; Her hand was so light that Rose said of
her secretly, in vague glances at the past, &ldquo;No wonder
people liked her!&rdquo;&nbsp; She never characterised the old
element of interference with her mother&rsquo;s respectability
more definitely than as &ldquo;people.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
people, it was true, for whom gentleness must have been
everything and who didn&rsquo;t demand a variety of
interests.&nbsp; The desire to &ldquo;go out&rdquo; was the one
passion that even a closer acquaintance with her parent revealed
to Rose Tramore.&nbsp; She marvelled at its strength, in the
light of the poor lady&rsquo;s history: there was comedy enough
in this unquenchable flame on the part of a woman who had known
such misery.&nbsp; She had drunk deep of every dishonour, but the
bitter cup had left her with a taste for lighted candles, for
squeezing up staircases and hooking herself to the human
elbow.&nbsp; Rose had a vision of the future years in which this
taste would grow with restored exercise&mdash;of her mother, in a
long-tailed dress, jogging on and on and on, jogging further and
further from her sins, through a century of the &ldquo;Morning
Post&rdquo; and down the fashionable avenue of time.&nbsp; She
herself would then be very old&mdash;she herself would be
dead.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore would cover a span of life for which
such an allowance of sin was small.&nbsp; The girl could laugh
indeed now at that theory of her being dragged down.&nbsp; If one
thing were more present to her than another it was the very
desolation of their propriety.&nbsp; As she glanced at her
companion, it sometimes seemed to her that if she had been a bad
woman she would have been worse than that.&nbsp; There were
compensations for being &ldquo;cut&rdquo; which Mrs. Tramore too
much neglected.</p>
<p>The lonely old lady in Hill Street&mdash;Rose thought of her
that way now&mdash;was the one person to whom she was ready to
say that she would come to her on any terms.&nbsp; She wrote this
to her three times over, and she knocked still oftener at her
door.&nbsp; But the old lady answered no letters; if Rose had
remained in Hill Street it would have been her own function to
answer them; and at the door, the butler, whom the girl had known
for ten years, considered her, when he told her his mistress was
not at home, quite as he might have considered a young person who
had come about a place and of whose eligibility he took a
negative view.&nbsp; That was Rose&rsquo;s one pang, that she
probably appeared rather heartless.&nbsp; Her aunt Julia had gone
to Florence with Edith for the winter, on purpose to make her
appear more so; for Miss Tramore was still the person most
scandalised by her secession.&nbsp; Edith and she, doubtless,
often talked over in Florence the destitution of the aged victim
in Hill Street.&nbsp; Eric never came to see his sister, because,
being full both of family and of personal feeling, he thought she
really ought to have stayed with his grandmother.&nbsp; If she
had had such an appurtenance all to herself she might have done
what she liked with it; but he couldn&rsquo;t forgive such a want
of consideration for anything of his.&nbsp; There were moments
when Rose would have been ready to take her hand from the plough
and insist upon reintegration, if only the fierce voice of the
old house had allowed people to look her up.&nbsp; But she read,
ever so clearly, that her grandmother had made this a question of
loyalty to seventy years of virtue.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s
forlornness didn&rsquo;t prevent her drawing-room from being a
very public place, in which Rose could hear certain words
reverberate: &ldquo;Leave her alone; it&rsquo;s the only way to
see how long she&rsquo;ll hold out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old
woman&rsquo;s visitors were people who didn&rsquo;t wish to
quarrel, and the girl was conscious that if they had not let her
alone&mdash;that is if they had come to her from her
grandmother&mdash;she might perhaps not have held out.&nbsp; She
had no friends quite of her own; she had not been brought up to
have them, and it would not have been easy in a house which two
such persons as her father and his mother divided between
them.&nbsp; Her father disapproved of crude intimacies, and all
the intimacies of youth were crude.&nbsp; He had married at
five-and-twenty and could testify to such a truth.&nbsp; Rose
felt that she shared even Captain Jay with her grandmother; she
had seen what <i>he</i> was worth.&nbsp; Moreover, she had spoken
to him at that last moment in Hill Street in a way which, taken
with her former refusal, made it impossible that he should come
near her again.&nbsp; She hoped he went to see his protectress:
he could be a kind of substitute and administer comfort.</p>
<p>It so happened, however, that the day after she threw Lady
Maresfield&rsquo;s invitation into the wastepaper basket she
received a visit from a certain Mrs. Donovan, whom she had
occasionally seen in Hill Street.&nbsp; She vaguely knew this
lady for a busybody, but she was in a situation which even
busybodies might alleviate.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan was poor, but
honest&mdash;so scrupulously honest that she was perpetually
returning visits she had never received.&nbsp; She was always
clad in weather-beaten sealskin, and had an odd air of being
prepared for the worst, which was borne out by her denying that
she was Irish.&nbsp; She was of the English Donovans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, won&rsquo;t you go out with me?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Rose looked at her a moment and then rang the bell.&nbsp; She
spoke of something else, without answering the question, and when
the servant came she said: &ldquo;Please tell Mrs. Tramore that
Mrs. Donovan has come to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be delightful; only you mustn&rsquo;t
tell your grandmother!&rdquo; the visitor exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I come to see your mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I hoped you&rsquo;d introduce me!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Donovan, compromising herself in her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary; you knew her once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and I&rsquo;ve known every one once,&rdquo; the
visitor confessed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore, when she came in, was charming and exactly
right; she greeted Mrs. Donovan as if she had met her the week
before last, giving her daughter such a new illustration of her
tact that Rose again had the idea that it was no wonder
&ldquo;people&rdquo; had liked her.&nbsp; The girl grudged Mrs.
Donovan so fresh a morsel as a description of her mother at home,
rejoicing that she would be inconvenienced by having to keep the
story out of Hill Street.&nbsp; Her mother went away before Mrs.
Donovan departed, and Rose was touched by guessing her
reason&mdash;the thought that since even this circuitous
personage had been moved to come, the two might, if left
together, invent some remedy.&nbsp; Rose waited to see what Mrs.
Donovan had in fact invented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come out with me then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughters are married.&nbsp; You know I&rsquo;m a
lone woman.&nbsp; It would be an immense pleasure to me to have
so charming a creature as yourself to present to the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go out with my mother,&rdquo; said Rose, after a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but sometimes when she&rsquo;s not
inclined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She goes everywhere she wants to go,&rdquo; Rose
continued, uttering the biggest fib of her life and only
regretting it should be wasted on Mrs. Donovan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but do you go everywhere <i>you</i> want?&rdquo;
the lady asked sociably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One goes even to places one hates.&nbsp; Every one does
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what I go through!&rdquo; this social martyr
cried.&nbsp; Then she laid a persuasive hand on the girl&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me show you at a few places first, and then
we&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring them all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand you,&rdquo; replied
Rose, though in Mrs. Donovan&rsquo;s words she perfectly saw her
own theory of the case reflected.&nbsp; For a quarter of a minute
she asked herself whether she might not, after all, do so much
evil that good might come.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan would take her out
the next day, and be thankful enough to annex such an attraction
as a pretty girl.&nbsp; Various consequences would ensue and the
long delay would be shortened; her mother&rsquo;s drawing-room
would resound with the clatter of teacups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bray&rsquo;s having some big thing next week; come
with me there and I&rsquo;ll show you what I mane,&rdquo; Mrs.
Donovan pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mane,&rdquo; Rose answered, brushing
away her temptation and getting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re wrong, my dear,&rdquo; said her
interlocutress, with angry little eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to Mrs. Bray&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a kyard; it&rsquo;ll only cost me a
penny stamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a penny stamp?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan,
especially at departure, always observed all the forms of
amity.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it alone, my
darling,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall they call you a cab?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick one up.&nbsp; I choose my horse.&nbsp;
You know you require your start,&rdquo; her visitor went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my mother,&rdquo; was Rose&rsquo;s only
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&nbsp; Come to me when you need
me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find me in the Red Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Donovan lingered a moment on the threshold.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who will you <i>have</i> now, my child?&rdquo; she
appealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have any one!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose turned
away, blushing for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;She came on
speculation,&rdquo; she said afterwards to Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>Her mother looked at her a moment in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can do it if you like, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose made no direct answer to this observation; she remarked
instead: &ldquo;See what our quiet life allows us to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t escape it.&nbsp; She has been here an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in twenty years!&nbsp; We might meet her three
times a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d take her with the rest!&rdquo; sighed
Mrs. Tramore; while her daughter recognised that what her
companion wanted to do was just what Mrs. Donovan was
doing.&nbsp; Mrs. Donovan&rsquo;s life was her ideal.</p>
<p>On a Sunday, ten days later, Rose went to see one of her old
governesses, of whom she had lost sight for some time and who had
written to her that she was in London, unoccupied and ill.&nbsp;
This was just the sort of relation into which she could throw
herself now with inordinate zeal; the idea of it, however, not
preventing a foretaste of the queer expression in the excellent
lady&rsquo;s face when she should mention with whom she was
living.&nbsp; While she smiled at this picture she threw in
another joke, asking herself if Miss Hack could be held in any
degree to constitute the nucleus of a circle.&nbsp; She would
come to see her, in any event&mdash;come the more the further she
was dragged down.&nbsp; Sunday was always a difficult day with
the two ladies&mdash;the afternoons made it so apparent that they
were not frequented.&nbsp; Her mother, it is true, was comprised
in the habits of two or three old gentlemen&mdash;she had for a
long time avoided male friends of less than seventy&mdash;who
disliked each other enough to make the room, when they were there
at once, crack with pressure.&nbsp; Rose sat for a long time with
Miss Hack, doing conscientious justice to the conception that
there could be troubles in the world worse than her own; and when
she came back her mother was alone, but with a story to tell of a
long visit from Mr. Guy Mangler, who had waited and waited for
her return.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in love with you; he&rsquo;s
coming again on Tuesday,&rdquo; Mrs. Tramore announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s coming back on Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that he&rsquo;s in love with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t need, when he stayed two
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you he&rsquo;s in love with,
mamma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do as well,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all the use we shall make of
him!&rdquo; she added in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall make great use of him.&nbsp; His mother sent
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll never come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>he</i> sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Rose.&nbsp; Yet he was admitted on the Tuesday, and after she had
given him his tea Mrs. Tramore left the young people alone.&nbsp;
Rose wished she hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;she herself had another
view.&nbsp; At any rate she disliked her mother&rsquo;s view,
which she had easily guessed.&nbsp; Mr. Mangler did nothing but
say how charming he thought his hostess of the Sunday, and what a
tremendously jolly visit he had had.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t remark
in so many words &ldquo;I had no idea your mother was such a good
sort&rdquo;; but this was the spirit of his simple
discourse.&nbsp; Rose liked it at first&mdash;a little of it
gratified her; then she thought there was too much of it for good
taste.&nbsp; She had to reflect that one does what one can and
that Mr. Mangler probably thought he was delicate.&nbsp; He
wished to convey that he desired to make up to her for the
injustice of society.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t her mother
receive gracefully, she asked (not audibly) and who had ever said
she didn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Mr. Mangler had a great deal to say about
the disappointment of his own parent over Miss Tramore&rsquo;s
not having come to dine with them the night of his aunt&rsquo;s
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Maresfield knows why I didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo;
Rose answered at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t, you know;
can&rsquo;t you tell <i>me</i>?&rdquo; asked the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, if your mother&rsquo;s clear
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but why make such an awful mystery of it, when
I&rsquo;m dying to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talked about this, he chaffed her about it for the rest of
his visit: he had at last found a topic after his own
heart.&nbsp; If her mother considered that he might be the emblem
of their redemption he was an engine of the most primitive
construction.&nbsp; He stayed and stayed; he struck Rose as on
the point of bringing out something for which he had not quite,
as he would have said, the cheek.&nbsp; Sometimes she thought he
was going to begin: &ldquo;By the way, my mother told me to
propose to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At other moments he seemed charged
with the admission: &ldquo;I say, of course I really know what
you&rsquo;re trying to do for her,&rdquo; nodding at the door:
&ldquo;therefore hadn&rsquo;t we better speak of it frankly, so
that I can help you with my mother, and more particularly with my
sister Gwendolen, who&rsquo;s the difficult one?&nbsp; The fact
is, you see, they won&rsquo;t do anything for nothing.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll accept me they&rsquo;ll call, but they won&rsquo;t
call without something &lsquo;down.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Mangler departed without their speaking frankly, and Rose Tramore
had a hot hour during which she almost entertained, vindictively,
the project of &ldquo;accepting&rdquo; the limpid youth until
after she should have got her mother into circulation.&nbsp; The
cream of the vision was that she might break with him
later.&nbsp; She could read that this was what her mother would
have liked, but the next time he came the door was closed to him,
and the next and the next.</p>
<p>In August there was nothing to do but to go abroad, with the
sense on Rose&rsquo;s part that the battle was still all to
fight; for a round of country visits was not in prospect, and
English watering-places constituted one of the few subjects on
which the girl had heard her mother express herself with
disgust.&nbsp; Continental autumns had been indeed for years, one
of the various forms of Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s atonement, but Rose
could only infer that such fruit as they had borne was
bitter.&nbsp; The stony stare of Belgravia could be practised at
Homburg; and somehow it was inveterately only gentlemen who sat
next to her at the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> at
Cadenabbia.&nbsp; Gentlemen had never been of any use to Mrs.
Tramore for getting back into society; they had only helped her
effectually to get out of it.&nbsp; She once dropped, to her
daughter, in a moralising mood, the remark that it was
astonishing how many of them one could know without its doing one
any good.&nbsp; Fifty of them&mdash;even very clever
ones&mdash;represented a value inferior to that of one stupid
woman.&nbsp; Rose wondered at the offhand way in which her mother
could talk of fifty clever men; it seemed to her that the whole
world couldn&rsquo;t contain such a number.&nbsp; She had a
sombre sense that mankind must be dull and mean.&nbsp; These
cogitations took place in a cold hotel, in an eternal Swiss rain,
and they had a flat echo in the transalpine valleys, as the
lonely ladies went vaguely down to the Italian lakes and
cities.&nbsp; Rose guided their course, at moments, with a kind
of aimless ferocity; she moved abruptly, feeling vulgar and
hating their life, though destitute of any definite vision of
another life that would have been open to her.&nbsp; She had set
herself a task and she clung to it; but she appeared to herself
despicably idle.&nbsp; She had succeeded in not going to Homburg
waters, where London was trying to wash away some of its stains;
that would be too staring an advertisement of their
situation.&nbsp; The main difference in situations to her now was
the difference of being more or less pitied, at the best an
intolerable danger; so that the places she preferred were the
unsuspicious ones.&nbsp; She wanted to triumph with contempt, not
with submission.</p>
<p>One morning in September, coming with her mother out of the
marble church at Milan, she perceived that a gentleman who had
just passed her on his way into the cathedral and whose face she
had not noticed, had quickly raised his hat, with a suppressed
ejaculation.&nbsp; She involuntarily glanced back; the gentleman
had paused, again uncovering, and Captain Jay stood saluting her
in the Italian sunshine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, good-morning!&rdquo;
she said, and walked on, pursuing her course; her mother was a
little in front.&nbsp; She overtook her in a moment, with an
unreasonable sense, like a gust of cold air, that men were worse
than ever, for Captain Jay had apparently moved into the
church.&nbsp; Her mother turned as they met, and suddenly, as she
looked back, an expression of peculiar sweetness came into this
lady&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; It made Rose&rsquo;s take the same
direction and rest a second time on Captain Jay, who was planted
just where he had stood a minute before.&nbsp; He immediately
came forward, asking Rose with great gravity if he might speak to
her a moment, while Mrs. Tramore went her way again.&nbsp; He had
the expression of a man who wished to say something very
important; yet his next words were simple enough and consisted of
the remark that he had not seen her for a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really so much as that?&rdquo; asked Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly.&nbsp; I would have looked you up, but in
the first place I have been very little in London, and in the
second I believed it wouldn&rsquo;t have done any
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have put that first,&rdquo; said the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have done any
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent over this a moment, in his customary deciphering
way; but the view he took of it did not prevent him from
inquiring, as she slowly followed her mother, if he
mightn&rsquo;t walk with her now.&nbsp; She answered with a laugh
that it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good but that he might do as he
liked.&nbsp; He replied without the slightest manifestation of
levity that it would do more good than if he didn&rsquo;t, and
they strolled together, with Mrs. Tramore well before them,
across the big, amusing piazza, where the front of the cathedral
makes a sort of builded light.&nbsp; He asked a question or two
and he explained his own presence: having a month&rsquo;s
holiday, the first clear time for several years, he had just
popped over the Alps.&nbsp; He inquired if Rose had recent news
of the old lady in Hill Street, and it was the only tortuous
thing she had ever heard him say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had no communication of any kind from her since
I parted with you under her roof.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t she
mentioned that?&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were such great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertram Jay hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, not so much
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she done to you?&rdquo; Rose demanded.</p>
<p>He fidgeted a little, as if he were thinking of something that
made him unconscious of her question; then, with mild violence,
he brought out the inquiry: &ldquo;Miss Tramore, are you
happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was startled by the words, for she on her side had been
reflecting&mdash;reflecting that he had broken with her
grandmother and that this pointed to a reason.&nbsp; It suggested
at least that he wouldn&rsquo;t now be so much like a mouthpiece
for that cold ancestral tone.&nbsp; She turned off his
question&mdash;said it never was a fair one, as you gave yourself
away however you answered it.&nbsp; When he repeated &ldquo;You
give yourself away?&rdquo; as if he didn&rsquo;t understand, she
remembered that he had not read the funny American books.&nbsp;
This brought them to a silence, for she had enlightened him only
by another laugh, and he was evidently preparing another
question, which he wished carefully to disconnect from the
former.&nbsp; Presently, just as they were coming near Mrs.
Tramore, it arrived in the words &ldquo;Is this lady your
mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; On Rose&rsquo;s assenting, with the addition
that she was travelling with her, he said: &ldquo;Will you be so
kind as to introduce me to her?&rdquo;&nbsp; They were so close
to Mrs. Tramore that she probably heard, but she floated away
with a single stroke of her paddle and an inattentive poise of
her head.&nbsp; It was a striking exhibition of the famous tact,
for Rose delayed to answer, which was exactly what might have
made her mother wish to turn; and indeed when at last the girl
spoke she only said to her companion: &ldquo;Why do you ask me
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I desire the pleasure of making her
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose had stopped, and in the middle of the square they stood
looking at each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you remember what you said
to me the last time I saw you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to speak of it now than to speak of
it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertram Jay looked round him, as if to see whether any one
would hear; but the bright foreignness gave him a sense of
safety, and he unexpectedly exclaimed: &ldquo;Miss Tramore, I
love you more than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have come to see us,&rdquo; declared
the girl, quickly walking on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You treated me the last time as if I were positively
offensive to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, but you know my reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I protested against the course you were
taking?&nbsp; I did, I did!&rdquo; the young man rang out, as if
he still, a little, stuck to that.</p>
<p>His tone made Rose say gaily: &ldquo;Perhaps you do so
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell till I&rsquo;ve seen more of your
circumstances,&rdquo; he replied with eminent honesty.</p>
<p>The girl stared; her light laugh filled the air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s in order to see more of them and judge that
you wish to make my mother&rsquo;s acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He coloured at this and he evaded; then he broke out with a
confused &ldquo;Miss Tramore, let me stay with you a
little!&rdquo; which made her stop again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your company will do us great honour, but there must be
a rigid condition attached to our acceptance of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly mention it,&rdquo; said Captain Jay, staring at
the fa&ccedil;ade of the cathedral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take us on trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make an observation to me&mdash;not a
single one, ever, ever!&mdash;on the matter that, in Hill Street,
we had our last words about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Jay appeared to be counting the thousand pinnacles of
the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you really must be right,&rdquo;
he remarked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; cried Rose Tramore, and walked
rapidly away.</p>
<p>He caught up with her, he laid his hand upon her arm to stay
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to Venice, let me go to
Venice with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even understand my
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, then: you must be
right about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in the least true, and I don&rsquo;t
care a fig whether you&rsquo;re sure or not.&nbsp; Please let me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had barred her way, he kept her longer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and speak to your mother myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in the midst of another emotion she was amused at the air
of audacity accompanying this declaration.&nbsp; Poor Captain Jay
might have been on the point of marching up to a battery.&nbsp;
She looked at him a moment; then she said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
disappointed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s much more proper than grandmamma, because
she&rsquo;s much more amiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Tramore&mdash;dear Miss Tramore!&rdquo; the
young man murmured helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself.&nbsp; Only there&rsquo;s
another condition,&rdquo; Rose went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo; he cried, with discouragement and
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand thoroughly, before you throw in
your lot with us even for a few days, what our position really
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very bad?&rdquo; asked Bertram Jay artlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has anything to do with us, no one speaks to us,
no one looks at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; stared the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no social existence, we&rsquo;re utterly
despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Tramore!&rdquo; Captain Jay interposed.&nbsp;
He added quickly, vaguely, and with a want of presence of mind of
which he as quickly felt ashamed: &ldquo;Do none of your
family&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; The question collapsed; the brilliant
girl was looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extraordinarily happy,&rdquo; she threw
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s all I wanted to know!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with a kind of exaggerated cheery reproach, walking on
with her briskly to overtake her mother.</p>
<p>He was not dining at their inn, but he insisted on coming that
evening to their <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; He sat
next Mrs. Tramore, and in the evening he accompanied them
gallantly to the opera, at a third-rate theatre where they were
almost the only ladies in the boxes.&nbsp; The next day they went
together by rail to the Charterhouse of Pavia, and while he
strolled with the girl, as they waited for the homeward train, he
said to her candidly: &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s remarkably
pretty.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remembered the words and the feeling
they gave her: they were the first note of new era.&nbsp; The
feeling was somewhat that of an anxious, gratified matron who has
&ldquo;presented&rdquo; her child and is thinking of the
matrimonial market.&nbsp; Men might be of no use, as Mrs. Tramore
said, yet it was from this moment Rose dated the rosy dawn of her
confidence that her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> would go off;
and when later, in crowded assemblies, the phrase, or something
like it behind a hat or a fan, fell repeatedly on her anxious
ear, &ldquo;Your mother <i>is</i> in beauty!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen her look better!&rdquo; she had a
faint vision of the yellow sunshine and the afternoon shadows on
the dusty Italian platform.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tramore&rsquo;s behaviour at this period was a revelation
of her native understanding of delicate situations.&nbsp; She
needed no account of this one from her daughter&mdash;it was one
of the things for which she had a scent; and there was a kind of
loyalty to the rules of a game in the silent sweetness with which
she smoothed the path of Bertram Jay.&nbsp; It was clear that she
was in her element in fostering the exercise of the affections,
and if she ever spoke without thinking twice it is probable that
she would have exclaimed, with some gaiety, &ldquo;Oh, I know all
about <i>love</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose could see that she thought
their companion would be a help, in spite of his being no
dispenser of patronage.&nbsp; The key to the gates of fashion had
not been placed in his hand, and no one had ever heard of the
ladies of his family, who lived in some vague hollow of the
Yorkshire moors; but none the less he might administer a muscular
push.&nbsp; Yes indeed, men in general were broken reeds, but
Captain Jay was peculiarly representative.&nbsp; Respectability
was the woman&rsquo;s maximum, as honour was the man&rsquo;s, but
this distinguished young soldier inspired more than one kind of
confidence.&nbsp; Rose had a great deal of attention for the use
to which his respectability was put; and there mingled with this
attention some amusement and much compassion.&nbsp; She saw that
after a couple of days he decidedly liked her mother, and that he
was yet not in the least aware of it.&nbsp; He took for granted
that he believed in her but little; notwithstanding which he
would have trusted her with anything except Rose herself.&nbsp;
His trusting her with Rose would come very soon.&nbsp; He never
spoke to her daughter about her qualities of character, but two
or three of them (and indeed these were all the poor lady had,
and they made the best show) were what he had in mind in praising
her appearance.&nbsp; When he remarked: &ldquo;What attention
Mrs. Tramore seems to attract everywhere!&rdquo; he meant:
&ldquo;What a beautifully simple nature it is!&rdquo; and when he
said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something extraordinarily harmonious
in the colours she wears,&rdquo; it signified: &ldquo;Upon my
word, I never saw such a sweet temper in my life!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She lost one of her boxes at Verona, and made the prettiest joke
of it to Captain Jay.&nbsp; When Rose saw this she said to
herself, &ldquo;Next season we shall have only to
choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rose knew what was in the box.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Venice (they had stopped at half a
dozen little old romantic cities in the most frolicsome
&aelig;sthetic way) she liked their companion better than she had
ever liked him before.&nbsp; She did him the justice to recognise
that if he was not quite honest with himself he was at least
wholly honest with <i>her</i>.&nbsp; She reckoned up everything
he had been since he joined them, and put upon it all an
interpretation so favourable to his devotion that, catching
herself in the act of glossing over one or two episodes that had
not struck her at the time as disinterested she exclaimed,
beneath her breath, &ldquo;Look out&mdash;you&rsquo;re falling in
love!&rdquo;&nbsp; But if he liked correctness wasn&rsquo;t he
quite right?&nbsp; Could any one possibly like it more than
<i>she</i> did?&nbsp; And if he had protested against her
throwing in her lot with her mother, this was not because of the
benefit conferred but because of the injury received.&nbsp; He
exaggerated that injury, but this was the privilege of a lover
perfectly willing to be selfish on behalf of his mistress.&nbsp;
He might have wanted her grandmother&rsquo;s money for her, but
if he had given her up on first discovering that she was throwing
away her chance of it (oh, this was <i>her</i> doing too!) he had
given up her grandmother as much: not keeping well with the old
woman, as some men would have done; not waiting to see how the
perverse experiment would turn out and appeasing her, if it
should promise tolerably, with a view to future operations.&nbsp;
He had had a simple-minded, evangelical, lurid view of what the
girl he loved would find herself in for.&nbsp; She could see this
now&mdash;she could see it from his present bewilderment and
mystification, and she liked him and pitied him, with the kindest
smile, for the original <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> as well as for
the actual meekness.&nbsp; No wonder he hadn&rsquo;t known what
she was in for, since he now didn&rsquo;t even know what he was
in for himself.&nbsp; Were there not moments when he thought his
companions almost unnaturally good, almost suspiciously
safe?&nbsp; He had lost all power to verify that sketch of their
isolation and <i>d&eacute;classement</i> to which she had treated
him on the great square at Milan.&nbsp; The last thing he noticed
was that they were neglected, and he had never, for himself, had
such an impression of society.</p>
<p>It could scarcely be enhanced even by the apparition of a
large, fair, hot, red-haired young man, carrying a lady&rsquo;s
fan in his hand, who suddenly stood before their little party as,
on the third evening after their arrival in Venice, it partook of
ices at one of the tables before the celebrated Caf&eacute;
Florian.&nbsp; The lamplit Venetian dusk appeared to have
revealed them to this gentleman as he sat with other friends at a
neighbouring table, and he had sprung up, with unsophisticated
glee, to shake hands with Mrs. Tramore and her daughter.&nbsp;
Rose recalled him to her mother, who looked at first as though
she didn&rsquo;t remember him but presently bestowed a
sufficiently gracious smile on Mr. Guy Mangler.&nbsp; He gave
with youthful candour the history of his movements and indicated
the whereabouts of his family: he was with his mother and
sisters; they had met the Bob Veseys, who had taken Lord
Whiteroy&rsquo;s yacht and were going to Constantinople.&nbsp;
His mother and the girls, poor things, were at the Grand Hotel,
but he was on the yacht with the Veseys, where they had Lord
Whiteroy&rsquo;s cook.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the food in Venice
filthy, and wouldn&rsquo;t they come and look at the yacht?&nbsp;
She wasn&rsquo;t very fast, but she was awfully jolly.&nbsp; His
mother might have come if she would, but she wouldn&rsquo;t at
first, and now, when she wanted to, there were other people, who
naturally wouldn&rsquo;t turn out for her.&nbsp; Mr. Mangler sat
down; he alluded with artless resentment to the way, in July, the
door of his friends had been closed to him.&nbsp; He was going to
Constantinople, but he didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;if <i>they</i>
were going anywhere; meanwhile his mother hoped awfully they
would look her up.</p>
<p>Lady Maresfield, if she had given her son any such message,
which Rose disbelieved, entertained her hope in a manner
compatible with her sitting for half an hour, surrounded by her
little retinue, without glancing in the direction of Mrs.
Tramore.&nbsp; The girl, however, was aware that this was not a
good enough instance of their humiliation; inasmuch as it was
rather she who, on the occasion of their last contact, had held
off from Lady Maresfield.&nbsp; She was a little ashamed now of
not having answered the note in which this affable personage
ignored her mother.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t help perceiving
indeed a dim movement on the part of some of the other members of
the group; she made out an attitude of observation in the
high-plumed head of Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey,
perhaps, might have been looking at Captain Jay, for as this
gentleman walked back to the hotel with our young lady (they were
at the &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; and young Mangler, who clung to
them, went in front with Mrs. Tramore) he revealed to Rose that
he had some acquaintance with Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s eldest
daughter, though he didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t
particularly want to know, her ladyship.&nbsp; He expressed
himself with more acerbity than she had ever heard him use
(Christian charity so generally governed his speech) about the
young donkey who had been prattling to them.&nbsp; They separated
at the door of the hotel.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore had got rid of Mr.
Mangler, and Bertram Jay was in other quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know Mrs. Vesey, why didn&rsquo;t you go and
speak to her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she saw you,&rdquo; Rose
said.</p>
<p>Captain Jay replied even more circumspectly than usual.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can go now; you&rsquo;re free,&rdquo; Rose
rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I shall never go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be civil,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be civil.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask too many questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I do,&rdquo; the girl acknowledged.</p>
<p>Captain Jay had already shaken hands with her, but at this he
put out his hand again.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too
worldly,&rdquo; he murmured, while he held Rose Tramore&rsquo;s a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you dear!&rdquo; Rose exclaimed almost audibly as,
with her mother, she turned away.</p>
<p>The next morning, upon the Grand Canal, the gondola of our
three friends encountered a stately barge which, though it
contained several persons, seemed pervaded mainly by one majestic
presence.&nbsp; During the instant the gondolas were passing each
other it was impossible either for Rose Tramore or for her
companions not to become conscious that this distinguished
identity had markedly inclined itself&mdash;a circumstance
commemorated the next moment, almost within earshot of the other
boat, by the most spontaneous cry that had issued for many a day
from the lips of Mrs. Tramore.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy, my dear, Lady
Maresfield has bowed to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have returned it,&rdquo; Rose answered; but
she looked at Bertram Jay, who was opposite to her.&nbsp; He
blushed, and she blushed, and during this moment was born a
deeper understanding than had yet existed between these
associated spirits.&nbsp; It had something to do with their going
together that afternoon, without her mother, to look at certain
out-of-the-way pictures as to which Ruskin had inspired her with
a desire to see sincerely.&nbsp; Mrs. Tramore expressed the wish
to stay at home, and the motive of this wish&mdash;a finer shade
than any that even Ruskin had ever found a phrase for&mdash;was
not translated into misrepresenting words by either the mother or
the daughter.&nbsp; At San Giovanni in Bragora the girl and her
companion came upon Mrs. Vaughan-Vesey, who, with one of her
sisters, was also endeavouring to do the earnest thing.&nbsp; She
did it to Rose, she did it to Captain Jay, as well as to
Gianbellini; she was a handsome, long-necked, aquiline person, of
a different type from the rest of her family, and she did it
remarkably well.&nbsp; She secured our friends&mdash;it was her
own expression&mdash;for luncheon, on the morrow, on the yacht,
and she made it public to Rose that she would come that afternoon
to invite her mother.&nbsp; When the girl returned to the hotel,
Mrs. Tramore mentioned, before Captain Jay, who had come up to
their sitting-room, that Lady Maresfield had called.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She stayed a long time&mdash;at least it seemed
long!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>The poor lady could laugh freely now; yet there was some
grimness in a colloquy that she had with her daughter after
Bertram Jay had departed.&nbsp; Before this happened Mrs.
Vesey&rsquo;s card, scrawled over in pencil and referring to the
morrow&rsquo;s luncheon, was brought up to Mrs. Tramore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean it all as a bribe,&rdquo; said the principal
recipient of these civilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a bribe?&rdquo; Rose repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to marry you to that boy; they&rsquo;ve seen
Captain Jay and they&rsquo;re frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear mamma, I can&rsquo;t take Mr. Mangler for a
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; But oughtn&rsquo;t we to go to the
luncheon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we&rsquo;ll go to the luncheon,&rdquo; Rose
said; and when the affair took place, on the morrow, she could
feel for the first time that she was taking her mother out.&nbsp;
This appearance was somehow brought home to every one else, and
it was really the agent of her success.&nbsp; For it is of the
essence of this simple history that, in the first place, that
success dated from Mrs. Vesey&rsquo;s Venetian
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and in the second reposed, by a subtle
social logic, on the very anomaly that had made it dubious.&nbsp;
There is always a chance in things, and Rose Tramore&rsquo;s
chance was in the fact that Gwendolen Vesey was, as some one had
said, awfully modern, an immense improvement on the exploded
science of her mother, and capable of seeing what a
&ldquo;draw&rdquo; there would be in the comedy, if properly
brought out, of the reversed positions of Mrs. Tramore and Mrs.
Tramore&rsquo;s diplomatic daughter.&nbsp; With a first-rate
managerial eye she perceived that people would flock into any
room&mdash;and all the more into one of hers&mdash;to see Rose
bring in her dreadful mother.&nbsp; She treated the cream of
English society to this thrilling spectacle later in the autumn,
when she once more &ldquo;secured&rdquo; both the performers for
a week at Brimble.&nbsp; It made a hit on the spot, the very
first evening&mdash;the girl was felt to play her part so
well.&nbsp; The rumour of the performance spread; every one
wanted to see it.&nbsp; It was an entertainment of which, that
winter in the country, and the next season in town, persons of
taste desired to give their friends the freshness.&nbsp; The
thing was to make the Tramores come late, after every one had
arrived.&nbsp; They were engaged for a fixed hour, like the
American imitator and the Patagonian contralto.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey
had been the first to say the girl was awfully original, but that
became the general view.</p>
<p>Gwendolen Vesey had with her mother one of the few quarrels in
which Lady Maresfield had really stood up to such an antagonist
(the elder woman had to recognise in general in whose veins it
was that the blood of the Manglers flowed) on account of this
very circumstance of her attaching more importance to Miss
Tramore&rsquo;s originality (&ldquo;Her originality be
hanged!&rdquo; her ladyship had gone so far as unintelligently to
exclaim) than to the prospects of the unfortunate Guy.&nbsp; Mrs.
Vesey actually lost sight of these pressing problems in her
admiration of the way the mother and the daughter, or rather the
daughter and the mother (it was slightly confusing)
&ldquo;drew.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Lady Maresfield&rsquo;s version
of the case that the brazen girl (she was shockingly coarse) had
treated poor Guy abominably.&nbsp; At any rate it was made known,
just after Easter, that Miss Tramore was to be married to Captain
Jay.&nbsp; The marriage was not to take place till the summer;
but Rose felt that before this the field would practically be
won.&nbsp; There had been some bad moments, there had been
several warm corners and a certain number of cold shoulders and
closed doors and stony stares; but the breach was effectually
made&mdash;the rest was only a question of time.&nbsp; Mrs.
Tramore could be trusted to keep what she had gained, and it was
the dowagers, the old dragons with prominent fangs and glittering
scales, whom the trick had already mainly caught.&nbsp; By this
time there were several houses into which the liberated lady had
crept alone.&nbsp; Her daughter had been expected with her, but
they couldn&rsquo;t turn her out because the girl had stayed
behind, and she was fast acquiring a new identity, that of a
parental connection with the heroine of such a romantic
story.&nbsp; She was at least the next best thing to her
daughter, and Rose foresaw the day when she would be valued
principally as a memento of one of the prettiest episodes in the
annals of London.&nbsp; At a big official party, in June, Rose
had the joy of introducing Eric to his mother.&nbsp; She was a
little sorry it was an official party&mdash;there were some other
such queer people there; but Eric called, observing the shade,
the next day but one.</p>
<p>No observer, probably, would have been acute enough to fix
exactly the moment at which the girl ceased to take out her
mother and began to be taken out by her.&nbsp; A later phase was
more distinguishable&mdash;that at which Rose forbore to inflict
on her companion a duality that might become oppressive.&nbsp;
She began to economise her force, she went only when the
particular effect was required.&nbsp; Her marriage was delayed by
the period of mourning consequent upon the death of her
grandmother, who, the younger Mrs. Tramore averred, was killed by
the rumour of her own new birth.&nbsp; She was the only one of
the dragons who had not been tamed.&nbsp; Julia Tramore knew the
truth about this&mdash;she was determined such things should not
kill <i>her</i>.&nbsp; She would live to do something&mdash;she
hardly knew what.&nbsp; The provisions of her mother&rsquo;s will
were published in the &ldquo;Illustrated News&rdquo;; from which
it appeared that everything that was not to go to Eric and to
Julia was to go to the fortunate Edith.&nbsp; Miss Tramore makes
no secret of her own intentions as regards this favourite.</p>
<p>Edith is not pretty, but Lady Maresfield is waiting for her;
she is determined Gwendolen Vesey shall not get hold of
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Vesey however takes no interest in her at
all.&nbsp; She is whimsical, as befits a woman of her fashion;
but there are two persons she is still very fond of, the
delightful Bertram Jays.&nbsp; The fondness of this pair, it must
be added, is not wholly expended in return.&nbsp; They are
extremely united, but their life is more domestic than might have
been expected from the preliminary signs.&nbsp; It owes a portion
of its concentration to the fact that Mrs. Tramore has now so
many places to go to that she has almost no time to come to her
daughter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She is, under her son-in-law&rsquo;s
roof, a brilliant but a rare apparition, and the other day he
remarked upon the circumstance to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,&rdquo; she replied,
smiling, &ldquo;she might have had her regular place at our
fireside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, how did I prevent it?&rdquo; cried
Captain Jay, with all the consciousness of virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ordered it otherwise, you goose!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she says, in the same spirit, whenever her husband commends her
(which he does, sometimes, extravagantly) for the way she
launched her mother: &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear&mdash;practically
it was <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
